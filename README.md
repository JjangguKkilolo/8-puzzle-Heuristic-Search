# 8-puzzle-Heuristic-Search

1. Comparison of navigation performance between Greedy Best First Search (GBFS) algorithm and Astar algorithm
2. Comparison of search performance between Astaralgaliths employing different heuristic functions (h1 and h2)

- Experimental Method: A comparative experiment on 10 randomly generated 8 puzzle problems of different difficulties

- Performance Scale: Number of created states (nodes), extended states (nodes), solution length

- Experimental Results: Completion of Comparison Table by Algorithm and Performance Scale for 10 Problems
